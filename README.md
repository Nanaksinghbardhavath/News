INTRODUCTION:
 Our Project is “NEWS WEBSITE”. It just works like other news websites
which provides us latest news of different categories like General News, News
related to Health, Science, Sports, Technology etc…
 For doing this Project we used programing languages like HTML, CSS and
JAVASCRIPT. We also used another important concept called API(Application
Programing Interface) to access News data from any other external source
which contains required data.
TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION:
For designing this website we used following:
➢ HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
➢ CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets )
➢ Javascript
➢ API(Application Programming Interface)
HTML:
➢ HTML is an acronym which stands for “HyperText Markup
Language” which is used for creating web pages and web
applications.
➢ It can only create static web pages.
➢ It is supported by all browsers.
➢ It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, Javascript etc.,
CSS:
➢ CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
➢ It styles web pages, defining layout fonts, colours and design
to enhance visual presentation and accessibility.
➢ CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so we can give a far better look to our HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
JAVASCRIPT:
Javascript is a versatile scripting language used for web development. It
enables dynamic content, interactivity and functionality on websites,
making it essential for front-end and back-end programming. 
About our API:
News API is a simple, easy-to-use API that returns results for current and historic news
articles published by over 1,50,000 worldwide sources.
You need an API key to use the API - this is a unique key that identifies your requests.
They're free while you're in development.
● Real time news access: In our web application we get live news.
● Customizable queries: Searching news based on the keywords.
● Metadata and analysis: Availability of detailed metadata for each article.
● Integration and scalability: By using the api keys we can ensure data integrity
